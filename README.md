# OGC CoverageJSON

This GitHub repository contains documents to produce an OGC Community Standard for CoverageJSON.

The starting point for the standard is the work by Jon Blower and Maik Riechert of Reading University, under the auspices of the EU Framework 7 MELODIES project in 2015, and other usage by NASA, NCAR and others. 

As there has been little development, though plenty of use, of CoverageJSON since the end of the EU project, and there is no clear governance framework, some key supporters of the format have agreed to ask OGC to adopt CoverageJSON, unchanged, as an OGC Community Standard.

After any adoption, it is proposed that the commonalities and differences with other OGC coverage payload formats, such as CIS-JSON, GeoTiff and NetCDF, be investigated with view to producing a developmental roadmap for CoverageJSON, to be pursued within the OGC governance framework.

So far, the Business Justfication for this plan has just finished a formal Public Comment period on 25 July 2021 and responses to the received comments are being processed.
