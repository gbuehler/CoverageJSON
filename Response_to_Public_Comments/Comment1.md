PART A

1. Evaluator: [CONTACT INFORMATION]

2. Submission: CoverageJSON as an OGC Community Standard (21-040r2)

- It is more than surprising that this public RFC takes place without prior motion nor discussion in the Coverages WG
- CoverageJSON does not support coverages, this has been stated by several experts independently in detail. The announcement is publishing a false statement.

2. Implementation Specification Section number: All
all

3. Criticality: [Major, Minor, Editorial, etc.] critical
