Comment 2, 13 July 2021:

    1. Simplify sentence in Justification: "The format supports the efficient download of useful quantities of data to lightweight clients, such as browsers and mobile applications, from data stores, enabling local manipulation of the data in a format familiar to, and popular with, web developers, and readily usable, for example, by science researchers."
    
    2. "One major difference ..." from what?

Response

These are just editorial improvements to the Justification document, rather that comments on the proposal.

An Improved version of the Justification has been created: [OGC21-040r3](https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=97619&version=1) and uploaded to the Pending folder in the OGC Portal.

    1. Sentence now reads: "The format supports the efficient download, from big data stores, of useful quantities of data to lightweight clients, such as browsers and mobile applications. This enables local manipulation of the data in a format familiar to, and popular with, web developers, and readily usable, for example, by science researchers."
    
    2. "One major difference from NetCDF ..."
    
    Another OGC Member who strongly supports the work has been added.
