|Coverage: any data representation that assigns values directly to spatio-temporal position | | | |
|A coverage is a function from a spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain to an attribute range | | | |
|A coverage associates a position within its domain to a record of values of defined data types | | | |
|A coverage is a mapping from a spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain to attribute values sharing the same type within the domain | | | |
|This document defines the relationship between the domain of a coverage and an associated attribute range | | | |
|The characteristics of the domain are defined whereas the characteristics of the attribute range are not part of this standard | | | |
|Coverage: feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its domain | | | |
|A coverage conceptually can be viewed as a function which, for every value of its domain set, provides a particular value taken from its range set; actually, a coverage may provide a set of values for a particular position | | | |
|Coordinates in a coverage are all expressed in one and the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS), its Native CRS | | | |
|Different views on this coverage concept exist | | | |
|While in general more than one value can be returned for a particular Direct Position, sometimes exactly one  value will be delivered | | | |
|The Domain Set of a coverage, as described by its Coordinate Reference System (CRS) consists of a number vof axes which together define some n-dimensional space, with n>0 | | | | 
|Axes can represent alternate representations of coordinate measurements | | | |
|Axes, without any spatial nor temporal semantics, might be called “abstract” | | | |
|The range of CRSs to be used is open-ended; CRSs not described nor mentioned in this standard might be used | | | |
|In a coverage, the domain and range sets may be organised in different ways, driven by practical considerations | | | |
|Some realization alternatives; concrete standards may or may not adopt these (Coverage by Partitioning, by Domain&Range, by Function), and may provide further ones | | | |
