## NASA, Yes Vote
From the Justification, I have three questions: 3.3 The WCS SWG has agreed to a future work item with a goal to make CIS and Coverage JSON consistent and compatible. My question: "Has the WCS SWG has agreed to make this a future work item ?" 8 Intellectual property rights: Will the contributor retain intellectual property rights? Yes My question: "Is the U.K. Met. Office the named contributor who will maintain the I.P. ?" In a 15 October missive from Chris Little (U.K. Met. Office), he states: "...Outside of OGC, there is no leverage to get the CoverageJSON supporters to do the work,..." My question: "If we do the work inside the OGC, what guarantees do we have that the I.P. holders will accept such work ?"
