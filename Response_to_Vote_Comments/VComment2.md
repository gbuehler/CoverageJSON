## NRCan Abstain Vote
While NRCan does not have sufficient knowledge of coverage standards considerations to vote yes or no, we recognize the substantial number of comments that have been put forward voicing concern with the proposed work item. We strongly encourage work item submitters to work with OGC and commenters to resolve these concerns.
