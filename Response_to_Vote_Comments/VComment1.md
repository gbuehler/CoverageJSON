## Comment 1 IGN No Vote, DGIWG Abstain Vote
The Work Item submitted to ballot is not clearly defined nor scoped, and the reference document submitted as CovJSON specification (https://covjson.org/spec/) is not acceptable as an OGC Coverage standards because the semantics is different from OGC/TC211 semantics (for coverage-related definitions) and because the relationship with existing OGC (and TC211) Coverage standards, with clear documentation of differences /mapping is not available / documented. Presently there is no reuse of any existing standardized (OGC / TC211) Coverage object or component, including the domain, range, grid and CRS. CovJSON appears as breaking (in its “implicit model”) the OGC/TC211 Coverage conceptual model and CIS implementation model. IGN considers that in this context, the minimum work for submitting an OGC acceptable (additional) coverage standard work item (or document) has NOT been done, and no evidence of any process for converging towards this aim before any publication as an OGC standard is provided. For facilitating decision and voting, sufficient technical comparison between CovJSON and CIS JSON should be provided. The IGN “no” vote could be changed when a clear submittal with material such as such comparison, and either of a Work Item with clear aims, or a draft charter in case of creation of a new SWG. More detailed comments on the justification document and the CovJSON have been uploaded at https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=99311
